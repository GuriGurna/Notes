
* computation
- computation  is of two types:
- declarative 
- imperative = how to do something 

* earliest computeers = having fixes programs
- calculators do specific problems

* stored program computer 
- take input from the used and perform accordingly

* memory contains 
- control centre - set of instructions 
- airthmetic logic unit-converts input into output
- program counter -helps changing the instructions 

* fixed set of primitives helps programmer to build a good program 

* python 
- python is a high lvl language - more advanced set of primitives are used as used in low lvl language 
- general lvl language 
- interpreted language understand-uses code and run the program rather than going through compiler and 
  catching the bugs
  
* syntax -how to put together the expressions or informatrion

* static sematics - helps to understand which programs are meaningful 

* full sematics - what does program means and what happen when we run it  

* two types of values 
- numbers- integers or float 
- string - set of characters 

* operators
   + - * /
