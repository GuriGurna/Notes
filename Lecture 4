* Decomposition 
- it is breaking of code into different modules
- each module make its own sence and can run independently

* abstraction 

* functions 
- let us break into modules
- make us supress details 

* def - creating a function 
- followed by a name 
- then we have (x) 
- x is an input we take from the user and will  be used everywhere it is seen in the function  

* return 
- it stops the whole computation and return the value of it 

* none 
- when return none is used it does not return any value from it 

-any bindings in the function to a particular variable will not affectg and golabal binding int he while code 
 
* recursion 
- taking a problem and breaking into steps and adding some stps for execution 
- inductive step 
- break problem into the simpler version of same problem and add some other steps
