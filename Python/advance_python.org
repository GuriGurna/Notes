* Exception handling in python 

- there ar emany types of errors that may occured in the program 
- we use try statemetn for handling the errors
- the code is written in the except section for handling 


* We can raise exception error 

- using raise keyyord in python


* Try with else clause 

- if the programs runs without throwing the error we can use else 
- and can write anything in it to check  if try runs ssucessfully


* Try with finally

- it runs errrespective of the exception if any error occured


* if __name__ == '__main__'

- the __name__ evaluates the module of the code form where it is rans 
- the __name__ is set to the __main__  if the modele is running directly from the command line 

- this function is used to check wheather the module is runnng directly or it is being imported to the another file 


* Global keyword 

- Global keyword  can be use in any function to to change local variable to Global 
- or it may be used to to define any variable in function 


* enumerate 

- we can write (for index , item in enumerate (list))  to print both the item with respective index of it 
print (item,index)


* List comperhension

- easy way to write a new list from old list with modification 
- new list = [i for i in old_list ]
- can be used for sets or dictionaries 


* Lambda Functions 

- this creates the functions using lambda kryword
- syntax : lambda arguments : expression 

* Other functions

- .join(list) is used to join any list 
- .format is used same as f string 


* Map ,Filter ,Reduce

** Map
- it is used for printing any list with modififcation in it 
- syntax = print(list(map(square,old_list)))   (square all the elemets of the list )

** Filter 
- it creates a new list an filter the list according to the function 
- list(filter(function ,list))

** Reduce
- reduce applies a rolling computation to sequential pair of elements 
- we have to import it from functools 
- value = reduce(function ,list)
